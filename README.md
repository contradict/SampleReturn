The source code and data for our robot
- [WPI Challenge Page](http://wp.wpi.edu/challenge/)

##Team Name
 * Survey

##Robot Name
 * "" 


## Proposal
As submitted to WPI in January. Needs an update.

#TODO
##Need to buy
 * Replace James's camera

##New Computers?
 * When?
 * Graphics Card?

##Mechanical
 * Double check camera FOV, perhaps new brackets
 * Stiffen Wheel Yokes?
 * Lighter deck plates?
 * Cut carousel to accommodate samples hanging below gripper fingers

##User Interface
 * Speech Synthesis
 * Soft Shutdown switch
 * Flashing Lights as described in rules
 * Mode Switch
   * joystick
   * logging
   * pre-cached
   * full search
 * Remote pause integration

##Motion
 * Tune velocity loops
 * Trajectory Following (as opposed to velocity control)
##Gripper
 * Full position mode control
 * Switch to MX64?
 * Verify Capture
 * Bin allocation
 * Use all gripper inputs
   * wrist angle
   * expected grip width
 * proper visual servo

##Navigation
 * Test ScaViSLAM on our problem
 * Sun Sensor?
 * IMU?
 * Global Map representation

##Sensing
 * Visualization for detections
 * Probabalistic detection model

##Planning
 * select global planning technique
 * select local planning technique
 * State Machine (or real planner?)

##Sample Sensors
 * Wood Block
 * Plates
 * Pre-Cached
